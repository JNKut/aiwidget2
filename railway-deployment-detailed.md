   - `https://ai-chat-widget-production-abcd1234.railway.app`
   - Or: `https://your-project-name.up.railway.app`
4. **Copy this URL** - this is your live application

### Step 15: Test Your Widget
1. Take your Railway URL and add `/widget` to the end
   - Example: `https://your-app.railway.app/widget`

- **Logs tab:** Shows any errors or issues
- **Deployments:** History of all deployments

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: "Application Error" when visiting widget URL
**Solution:**

2. Look at deployment logs for specific errors
3. Ensure OPENAI_API_KEY has available credits

### Issue: Widget loads but doesn't chat
**Solution:**
1. Verify DATABASE_URL connects successfully
2. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
3. Ensure all files uploaded to GitHub correctly

### Issue: Build fails repeatedly
**Solution:**
1. Verify package.json exists in repository root
2. Check all project files uploaded correctly
3. Try redeploying from Deployments tab
